        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Quizathon is an innovative and user-friendly quiz website that is designed for the usage of teachers, students, and as well as trivia enthusiasts. The primary objective of this project is to make a fully functional quiz website equipped with facilities that are going to engage the users that will use our platform to conduct quiz or trivia contests. It will be a great way of learning for the students.</p>
        <p>In this project, we will be using Cloud Computing to store the data that is going to further help make the website better.</p>
        <p>Previous research in the field of online trivia/quizzes has shown that interactive learning platforms can significantly enhance the engagement of the students and the teachers as well helping the students with their knowledge retention.</p>
        <p>Building upon on the research our website aims to investigate the effectiveness of quizzes in promoting learning. This project will analyze the user engagement numbers, such as the quiz completion rates and time spent per quiz by the student, to evaluate the impact of different quiz formats and topics on user participation.</p>
        <p>To achieve these objectives, our website will utilize a variety of research methods. These research methods include user surveys to gather feedback, data analysis of user interactions to understand user behavior, and studies between different quiz formats to determine the most effective approach.</p>
        <p>By continuously improving based on the feedback and data analysis, Quizathon aims to become a good website that can be used by our college teachers to perform various quiz activities or to conduct online exams.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, Quizathon seeks to provide an enjoyable and educational experience for users by offering a wide range of quiz topics and formats that suits every studentâ€™s interest and learning style.</p>
